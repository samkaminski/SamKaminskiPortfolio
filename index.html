            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! I'm a Junior studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan, and I'm set to graduate in 2026 with a Bachelor's degree. I'm interested
                 in exploring fields like Software Development, Technical Consulting, and Technical Sales. I'm always eager to broaden my horizons by trying new things,
                  gaining experience in different areas, and meeting new people. This semester, I'm taking two Computer Science courses: EECS 376, which covers the theory
                   of computation, including topics like Turing machines, decidability, NP-hardness, and cryptography, and EECS 370, which focuses on computer organization, 
                   assembly language, processor performance, and more. Most of my technical experience is in C++, C, HTML, CSS, and R, but by the end of this year, I'm hoping
                    to expand my skills in Python, SQL, and Machine Learning.</p>

            <p>This semester, I joined a campus student organization called Michigan Hackers, and I'm super excited to be part of the Open-Source Development
                 team. On this team, I've been able to deepen my understanding of large codebases and sharpen my teamwork skills by contributing to complex 
                 open-source projects. Working with diverse teams has also improved my ability to manage projects efficiently. I'm really looking forward to the 
                 rest of the year with this group! 
            </p>

            <h1>This Website</h1>
            <p>I've always wanted to learn Web Development, but my busy school schedule has kept me from starting. As soon as I got 
                home for summer break, I knew it was the perfect time to begin. To gain the necessary skills for building this website, 
                I enrolled in HTML5 and CSS3 courses offered by the University of Michigan. I've attached those certifications below.

                This website is still a work in progress! My next steps are to implement some JavaScript to make it dynamic. I hope to 
                create a simple blog where I can make posts and upload images. Here, I'll share my normal life, including pictures of 
                food I make, photos of my cottage as it's being built, and much more!
            </p>
